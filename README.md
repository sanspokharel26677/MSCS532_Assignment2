# MSCS532_Assignment2

1. To run this code, python3 is required. 
2. python3 command can be used to run the file from terminal
3. Assignment filename is 'compare.py'
4. It implements Quick sort and Merge sort algorithm and then generate some dataset to compare the efficiency of these algorithms on various datasets. 
5. Its also generates png images of the efficiency and memory usage comparison
6. Images that are already in the repo and file named 'execution_time_and_memory_usage_info.txt' are generated by program when running through dataset from my machine and might be different while running from different machine with different capacity. 
7. Program generates image for the graph for visualization and the information generated is also presented in terminal after running however it does not save the information in text file or such. The one text file in the repo, I manually saved it after running the program
8. "observed discrepancies between theoretical analysis and practical performance" section is made in different report as the original report was getting longer and in the instruction it was only supposed to be 3-4 pages. The name of the report file is "Theory_vs_Observed.pdf". pdf is extracted from word file as work was behaving strange with maths equations and symbols. Sometimes, it was showing real equation and sometime it was showing placeholders even though I myself created the equation in word. After saving it was behaving starange.
